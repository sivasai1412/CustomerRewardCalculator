## Overview

The rewards program calculates based on following rules:
- **2 points** for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction.
- **1 point** for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.

For Example:
- A $120 purchase = (2 x 20) + (1 x 50) = 90 points

## Features

- **Calculating Monthly rewards for Customer**: Retrieves the monthly reward points for a specified customer.
- **Get Rewards Summary for Latest Three-month period**: Provides a summary of rewards for each customer over the latest three month period specified by a start month.
- **Calculate Reward for amount**: This provides the calculation of reward for the amount given.

## Testing

Unit tests are written to ensure each functionality of API works as expected.
-  Calculating Monthly rewards for Customer: Tests the monthly reward for the customer.
-  Get Rewards Summary for Latest Three-month period: Tests rewards for each customer over the latest three month period specified by a start month
-  Calculate Reward for amount: Tests the calculation of reward for the amount given.

### Asynchronous API Call

A test added to simulate the asynchronous api call using `CompletableFuture`. This test validates the ability to handle async class within the service layer.

```java
    @Test
    public void testFetchAsync() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException, TimeoutException {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = apiService.fetchDataSync();

        String result = future.get(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        assertEquals("Fetched data", result, "The asynchronous fetched data");

        assertTrue(future.isDone());
    }
```

Tests are located in the `src/test/java` directory. They can be run using  Maven:
```bash
mvn test
```
The test results are output to `target/surefire-reports`.

## Setup and Running

**1. Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DinakarAk/CustomerRewardCalculator.git
cd CustomerRewardCalculator
```
**2. Build the project if maven installed in your local**:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
**3. Run the application**:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
**4. Access the API**: The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`

## Database (H2)
The application uses in memory H2 database for testing and development process.
- schema.sql: This defines database schema, including tables for `Customer` and `Transaction`.
- data.sql: This populates the database data by using INSERT commands to stimulate the real time transactions.

**Sample `schema.sql`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Customer (id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Transaction (id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, customer_id INT NOT NULL, amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL, transaction_date DATE NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(id));
```

**Sample `data.sql`**

```sql
INSERT INTO Customer (name) VALUES ('Siva Sai');
INSERT INTO Customer (name) VALUES ('Anjuri');

INSERT INTO Transaction (customer_id, amount, transaction_date) VALUES (1, 120.00, '2024-11-25');
INSERT INTO Transaction (customer_id, amount, transaction_date) VALUES (1, 120.00, '2024-10-25');
INSERT INTO Transaction (customer_id, amount, transaction_date) VALUES (1, 75.00, '2024-09-25');
INSERT INTO Transaction (customer_id, amount, transaction_date) VALUES (1, 200.00, '2024-08-25');

INSERT INTO Transaction (customer_id, amount, transaction_date) VALUES (2, 95.00, '2024-10-13');
INSERT INTO Transaction (customer_id, amount, transaction_date) VALUES (2, 110.00, '2024-09-12');
INSERT INTO Transaction (customer_id, amount, transaction_date) VALUES (2, 60.00, '2024-08-17');


```
